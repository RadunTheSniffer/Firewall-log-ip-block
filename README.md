# Firewall Log Automation Script

## Overview

The idea is to create a script for universal firewall log filtering. Firewall log varies from different vendors like Palo Alto, Cisco and many more. The idea is to utilize machine learning techniques to create a program that 
can detect relevant data from different firewall logs format. 

We will be exploring the methods and create a script for each of said method.


## Process

The main process is stated as below

- Data Ingestion
  - Ingest data from different logs (CSV, .txt, JSON) 
- Preprocessing
  - Extract key features like timestamps, IPs, etc., through regex, rule based extraction or ML models
- Normalization
  - Sort extracted data into a universal structure
- Analysis
  - Begin analysis.
